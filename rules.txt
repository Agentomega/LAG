Regular Expressions Overview:

Regular expressions are a form of pattern matching that allow us
to check if a pattern is within a string, and extract groups based upon them.

"." is a wildcard and matches any character.

"*" matches 0 to infinity of the preceeding character.  It is greedy.
Therefore, ".*" will match the entire string.

"+" matches 1 to infinity of the preceeding character.  It is also greedy.

"?" means that the preceeding expression may or may not be in the match.

"|" is essentially the same as or - it applies some number of expressions separated
by a generalized disjunction.

Any statement surrounded by parentheses in a regular expression will save
whatever the middle part matches as a subgroup of the matched sequence.
For instance, matching "abbbbbbc" with ".(b+)." would return the groups:
"abbbbbbc" and "bbbbbb".

Any character(s) surrounded by square brackets ([]) becomes a literal. One may also match
ranges of characters.  For example:
"[?]" matches the literal '?' without meaning the conditional as expressed above.
"[A-Za-z]" matches any alphabetical character.
